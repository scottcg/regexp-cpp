get rid of match static collection of engine/regex - move to compile state

compile state re_compile_state
  compiled_expression job or task
  engine_state

  really nice to get rid of thing and save the state in engine

  re_engine -> basic_engine
  get rid of this static const re_match_vector	default_matches;
